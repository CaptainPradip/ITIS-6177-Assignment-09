Functions can be implemented by using many different computer languages and by using many different platforms. Since this class is not a programming class, I am ok if you want to choose the programming language that you are more familiar with and use the platform that you prefer.  That said, please create 1 (one) function that receives 1 (one) parameter and then returns your name plus that parameter. Example: If the query parameter "keyword" is set to "hello", then your Function should return "YOUR-NAME says hello".  So... If I try to use your REST API like this:  GET http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000/say?keyword=hello  Once I send this GET request to your web service in Digital Ocean, it should forward the request to your Function, the function executes, return the response to your web service, and your web service will return the response to me.  In other words, your web service will be a bridge between me and your Function. I know that this scapes the concept of REST, but let's do it in this way because by this time you already have a REST Web Service up and running at Digital Ocean. Just keep in mind that this is just so we can practice Functions... and it is not part of the REST exercise anymore.
